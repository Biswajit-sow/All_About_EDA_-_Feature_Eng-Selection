# 🧠 All About EDA – Feature Engineering & Feature Selection

Welcome to the **All About EDA** repository — a complete beginner-to-advanced guide to **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Feature Engineering (FE)**, and **Feature Selection (FS)**.
If you're starting your journey into **data science** or **machine learning**, this is one of the first steps you **must master** before diving into modeling.

## 📘 What's Inside
🔹**Three  Datset example of EDA and fE ,FS**--
One is Zomato & Country-code and another is Blackfriday-train & Blackfriday-test dataset

🔹 **Keyboardwritten Notes**--
Clear and concise keyboardwritten notes are included to make concepts easier to understand — perfect for visual learners.

🔹 **Practical Code Examples**--
Step-by-step code for EDA, feature engineering, and feature selection using `pandas`, `sklearn`, and more.

🔹 **Text Summary Files**--
Quick `.txt` files explaining all EDA, FS & FE concepts for quick revision and interview prep.
